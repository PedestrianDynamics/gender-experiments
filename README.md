## Data
Single-file movement experiments conducted under comparable conditions across five distinct countries:
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ China
- ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japan
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany 
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ Palestine 

The primary variable altered in these experiments are density (number of people increased gradually) and the gender composition, which includes categories such as male-only, female-only, randomly mixed, and alternatively mixed runs. 

A more detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.34735/ped.2024.1).

The German experiment, detailed at https://doi.org/10.34735/ped.2021.2, was part of an experimental series for the CroMa and CrowdDNA projects. These experiments took place at the Mitsubishi Electric Halle in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, in 2021.
